## Implementation Tips

### For Each Phase:
1. **Start Simple**: Implement basic version first
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure stability before adding features  
3. **Profile Performance**: Measure impact of changes
4. **Document**: Add clear comments and usage instructions

### Recommended Implementation Order:
1. Enhanced color schemes (visual impact, easy implementation)
2. Configuration system (foundation for other features)
3. Performance profiling (helps guide optimization efforts)
4. Export features (practical utility)
5. Advanced navigation (user experience)
6. Additional fractals (mathematical interest)

### Tools and Libraries to Consider:
- **Image Export**: stb_image_write for PNG/BMP
- **Configuration**: Simple key=value parser or JSON
- **GUI**: Dear ImGui for immediate mode GUI
- **Performance**: Intel VTune or perf for profiling
- **Math**: GNU MPFR for arbitrary precision
- **GPU**: OpenCL for GPU acceleration

This roadmap provides a structured approach to improving the fractal project while maintaining code quality and user experience.
